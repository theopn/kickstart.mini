# Kickstart.mini

Kickstart.mini is a replica of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) using [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) exclusively.
It can provide many quality-of-life improvements you would expect from a modern Neovim config with just one plugin, suited as a starting point to build your own config.
